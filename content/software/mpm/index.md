title: Matrix Population Model
date: "2019-01-01"
---
A size-structured matrix population model to estimate rates of cell division, cell growth and cell mortality of cyanobacteria populations from SeaFlow data.<br/>

These estimates are independent of variations in cell abundance and can be used to study physiologically-driven changes in population dynamics.<br/>
We are currently working on a new Bayesian formulation of the [model](https://github.com/fribalet/Bayesian-matrixmodel) to estimate hourly cell growth and cell mortality rates for <i>Prochlorococcus</i> and <i>Synechococcus</i> across all SeaFlow data. More details coming soon ...
