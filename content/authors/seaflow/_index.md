The SeaFlow instrument is a shipboard underway flow cytometer that provides continuous multi-parameter single particle measurements without the need for clean water. Sample directly from ship intake while steaming or on station.<br/>
The SeaFlow instrument was developed by [Jarred Swalwell](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/swalwell/) at the University of Washington. 

**Performance**
Sample volume, measurement rates and sensitivity equivalent to the best conventional flow cytometry systems.

​**Applications**
- Ocean research
- Environmental monitoring
- Water quality management
- Aquaculture

 The [SeaFlow Instruments](https://www.seaflowinstruments.com/) manufacturing and support facility is located in beautiful Edmonds, Washington, USA.  Please feel free to [contact SeaFlow Inc.](mailto:seaflowinstruments@gmail.com) with any questions related to the SeaFlow instrument and technologies.
